# Edge-Triggered-T-Flip-Flop
This is a circuit design of T Flip-Flop using Integrated Injection Logic. The circuit is a biastable multivibrator implemented with I2L.

The circuit can be simulared in the multisim file and produced correct results of a the T flip flop.

The ultiboard file contains the PCB design of circuit and can be printed.

The report gives an introduction about the topic and states all necessary steps needed to create the circuit including the parts needed to do so.
